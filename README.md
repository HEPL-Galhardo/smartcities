Raspberry Pi Pico


Introduction of Pico

No one expected that Raspberry Pi, the most popular single-board computer maker in 
the world, would suddenly release a microcontroller of its own. What's more surprising is that 
Raspberry Pi Pico does not base its design on the common ESP32 or SAMD21, but instead a 
brand new microcontroller chip: the RP2040 microcontroller. The RP2040 microcontroller is a 
microcontroller chip independently designed by Raspberry Pi, and is powered by a dual-core ARM 
Cortex-M0+ processor that runs up to 133Mhz.

GPIO Pins

In addition to the powerful new chip, the board of Raspberry Pi Pico exposes 26 multifunction GPIO pins, including 2 * SPI, 2 * I2C, 2 * UART, 3 * 12-bit ADC, and 16 controllable 
PWM channels. I will explain the functions of these pins in later chapters.
In addition to these GPIO pins, Pico also has eight ground pins and a series of power pins. 
In this course, however, we will not utilize them as we will not be performing tedious wiring with 
breadboards or DuPont wires when building projects. The expansion board — Grove Shield for Pi 
Pico — will helps you do this instead.
