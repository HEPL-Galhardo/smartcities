## Library explanation

  ws2812.py is a  library for Micropython that defines a class named WS2812, and contains several methods that represent commands that can be sent to a LED strip.

  Here is a brief explanation of each method:

  - `__init__`(self, pin_num, led_count, brightness = 0.5): Constructor method for initializing the WS2812 object with the given pin number, number of LEDs, and brightness (default 0.5). It initializes a StateMachine object with PIO (Programmable Input/Output) ASM (Assembler) code for controlling the WS2812 LED strip, sets the sideset base to the given pin number, and creates an array of unsigned 32-bit integers to store the color values of each LED.

  - `pixels_show`(self): Sends the current color values to the WS2812 LED strip by shifting out the 24-bit RGB values for each LED using the configured state machine. It applies the set brightness to the color values before sending them.

  - `pixels_set`(self, i, color): Sets the color of the LED at index i to the specified RGB color. The color value is packed into an unsigned 32-bit integer in the format 0x00RRGGBB.

  - `pixels_fill`(self, color): Sets the color of all LEDs to the specified RGB color.

  - `color_chase`(self, color, wait): Cycles through the LEDs with the specified RGB color, creating a chasing effect. It sets the color of each LED, waits for the specified time, and then calls pixels_show() to update the LED strip.

  - `wheel`(self, pos): Generates an RGB color value based on the position pos in a color wheel. The input pos value is expected to be between 0 and 255. The function uses an algorithm to map the input value to an RGB color value.

  - `rainbow_cycle`(self, wait): Cycles through the colors of a rainbow, one LED at a time, creating a rainbow effect. It sets the color of each LED to a color value generated by wheel(), waits for the specified time, and then calls pixels_show() to update the LED strip.

  All of these methods use the pixels_show() method to update the LED strip with the current color values stored in the array. It is important to call pixels_show() after changing the color of any LED to ensure that the changes are applied to the LED strip.

  - [rgb_leds.py](https://github.com/HEPL-Galhardo/smartcities/blob/main/LED_neo/rgb_leds.py)
  
* Display a different colors on a LED_neo module according to a light and sound sensor
  - LED_neo module is wired to the Raspberry Pico W on ***pin 18***, the light sensor to ***pin ADC0*** and the sound sensor to the ***pin ADC1*** (see demo and link below)
    - If there's light then the led displays white, if the noise is too laud then the led displays red, for medium noise orange light and for low noise green light.
